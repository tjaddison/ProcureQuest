I created 12 scenarios for students/players to participate in tandem with the ProcureSci solution, not sure what to call the game, temporarily I named it "ProcureSci Play". Essentially, each week a student will be prompted with a scenario, they will be given the pre-made list of supplier names, contract numbers and annual spend pre-populated into the ProcureSci tool. The "Optimal Decision" below will be hidden, each player/team will review the Issue, challenge, opportunity, and cost; they will be required to visit the macro and/or micro view in the ProcureSci solution and determine their decision based on the information available. Each class will consist of a discussion around that week's prompt. Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,

ProcureSci Play

Okay, this is a fantastic foundation for an educational game! Turning these scenarios into an engaging web-based game requires blending the learning objectives with modern game design principles. Let's call it **"ProcureQuest: The Supply Chain Challenge"**.

Here’s a concept for a web browser-based game built around your scenarios:

**Game Name:** ProcureQuest: The Supply Chain Challenge

**Core Concept:** Players take on the role of a Procurement Manager at a dynamic (fictional) company. Each week (or game session), they face one of the 12 critical supply chain scenarios. They must analyze the situation, use simulated data tools (inspired by ProcureSci), make a strategic decision, and see the consequences unfold.

**Platform:** Web Browser (HTML, CSS, JavaScript - potentially using a simple framework like React, Vue, or Angular for structure, but vanilla JS is also feasible).

**Target Audience:** Students learning procurement principles.

**Game Objective:** Successfully navigate the 12 scenarios by making the most strategically sound and cost-effective decisions, maximizing company performance metrics (e.g., profitability, risk mitigation, ESG score, production stability) while managing a budget.

**Modern Game Design Elements & Features:**

1.  **Dashboard Interface:**
    * A clean, professional-looking dashboard representing the Procurement Manager's workspace.
    * **Key Metrics Display:** Continuously visible metrics like:
        * `Company Budget/Profitability:` Starts high, decisions impact this.
        * `Supply Chain Risk Score:` Starts moderate, decisions increase/decrease it.
        * `Production Stability:` (e.g., On-Time Delivery %) Starts high, poor decisions impact it.
        * `Reputation/ESG Score:` Starts neutral, impacted by ethical/sustainability choices.
    * **Scenario Queue:** Shows the current scenario and perhaps previews the next one.

2.  **Scenario Presentation:**
    * Each scenario is presented clearly: Title, Issue, Challenge, Opportunity.
    * Supplier data (Name, Contract #, Spend) is displayed prominently.

3.  **Simulated "ProcureSci" Data Analysis Phase:**
    * **Crucial Step:** Instead of *actually* requiring the external tool during gameplay (which breaks immersion), the game *simulates* the analysis process.
    * **Interactive Data Views:** Players click buttons like:
        * `"Analyze Supplier Performance":` Shows simplified charts/scores for the listed suppliers (e.g., risk rating, delivery history, quality score).
        * `"View Market Intelligence":` Provides brief insights relevant to the scenario (e.g., "Semiconductor prices rising globally," "CBAM regulations coming into effect," "AI forecasting gaining traction").
        * `"Check Internal Impact":` Shows potential effects on production, finance, or R&D based on the issue.
        * `"Assess Alternatives":` Might reveal potential alternative suppliers or solutions (like the optimal decision hints at).
    * *This phase encourages players to think about *what* data they need before deciding.*

4.  **Decision Point:**
    * Clearly presents the "Your Decision" prompt.
    * Offers **Multiple Choice Options (3-4):**
        * One option is the "Optimal Decision" (rephrased).
        * Other options are plausible but less effective alternatives (e.g., cheaper but riskier, addresses only part of the problem, maintains status quo).
        * For classification scenarios (6, 11, 12), present the four options (Critical / Strategic / Transactional / Acquisitional).

5.  **Outcome & Feedback Loop:**
    * **Immediate Consequences:** After deciding, the game shows the immediate impact:
        * Budget adjusted based on the chosen action (using "Quote" and "Transition Cost" for the optimal path, or simulated costs/losses for others).
        * Changes to Risk Score, Production Stability, Reputation/ESG metrics are visualized (e.g., meters go up/down).
    * **Reveal Optimal Decision:** The game explicitly states the recommended "Optimal Decision."
    * **Rationale/Learning:** A concise explanation appears, clarifying *why* the optimal decision is best, referencing procurement principles (risk diversification, TCO, strategic alignment, ESG importance, innovation value, etc.). This is the core learning moment.
    * **Narrative Flair:** Short text updates describe the outcome (e.g., "Production lines are back online!", "Reputational damage contained," "Costs increased, but risk mitigated," "Missed opportunity leads to competitor advantage").

6.  **Progression & Scoring:**
    * Players progress through the 12 scenarios sequentially.
    * **Score Calculation:** Points awarded based on how close the player's decision was to the optimal one and its impact on the key metrics. A final score is given after Scenario 12.
    * **Leaderboard (Optional):** For classroom use, a simple leaderboard showing student/team scores adds a competitive element.
    * **Badges/Achievements (Optional):** Award badges for achieving certain goals (e.g., "Risk Master" for navigating risk scenarios well, "ESG Champion" for ethical choices, "Innovation Scout" for embracing new tech).

7.  **User Experience (UX) / Fun Factor:**
    * **Visual Polish:** Use icons, simple graphics, and a consistent color scheme. Avoid walls of text; break information down.
    * **Pacing:** Keep the analysis and decision phases relatively quick to maintain engagement.
    * **Sense of Agency:** Players feel their choices matter through visible impacts on metrics and narrative outcomes.
    * **Low Friction:** Easy to start and play in a browser, no complex setup.

**How it Addresses the "In Tandem with ProcureSci" Aspect:**

* The game's simulated analysis phase *primes* the students on *what kind* of information and analysis (like that provided by ProcureSci) is needed to make informed procurement decisions.
* After playing the scenario in "ProcureQuest," the classroom discussion can involve students using the *actual* ProcureSci tool with the pre-populated data to perform a deeper dive, validating the game's optimal decision or exploring nuances the game simplified. The game provides the context and the initial challenge; the tool allows for deeper exploration.

**Example Flow (Scenario 1 - Semiconductor Shortage):**

1.  **Dashboard:** Shows current budget, risk, stability, reputation. "New Scenario: Semiconductor Shortage" appears.
2.  **Scenario Screen:** Displays Issue, Challenge, Opportunity, Supplier List for SC-101, SC-202, SC-303.
3.  **Analysis Phase:** Player clicks:
    * `"Analyze Supplier Performance"` -> Shows NanoCore/VoltEdge have 'High' delivery risk, GlobalSilica 'Medium'.
    * `"View Market Intelligence"` -> Shows "Lead times doubled globally. Prices up 50%."
    * `"Assess Alternatives"` -> Mentions "Regional suppliers exist, shorter lead times possible but integration costs apply."
4.  **Decision Screen:** "What action would you take?"
    * A. Wait and hope existing suppliers deliver.
    * B. Pay premium expediting fees to existing suppliers.
    * C. Diversify: Engage regional suppliers, build buffer stock, implement tracking. (Optimal)
    * D. Halt non-essential production lines.
5.  **Outcome Screen:** (If C is chosen)
    * "Decision: Diversify Suppliers & Build Buffers."
    * "Impact: Budget Reduced by $1.65M ($450K Quote + $1.2M Transition). Risk Score Decreased Significantly. Production Stability Increased Moderately."
    * "Optimal Decision Revealed: Source from alternative regional suppliers, build strategic inventory buffers, and invest in real-time supply chain visibility tools."
    * "Rationale: This approach tackles the immediate shortage (alternatives, buffers) and addresses future vulnerability (visibility), securing long-term stability despite upfront costs."
    * "Narrative: New supplier contracts signed. Initial inventory buffer secured. Production delays minimized!"
6.  **Dashboard Updates:** Metrics change. Player moves to Scenario 2.

This structure turns the static scenarios into an interactive, decision-based learning experience with clear feedback loops, addressing the need for a fun, modern, educational procurement game.
